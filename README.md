## Hello, I am Yi JinðŸ‘‹ðŸ˜„

I love helping others and solving problems. That was also one of the reasons for me to be a financial advisor, assisting others to resolve their financial issues. Starting a career in software engineering would be more satisfying for me, knowing that the product I create would help a much larger group of people, making their lives better, and of course, solving problems at a much larger scale. I also enjoy the satisfaction of creating things which is part of a software engineerâ€™s daily life. 
 
Working as a financial advisor has taught me how to efficiently and effectively communicate with people, and understand their needs. Communication skill makes a crucial part of a software engineerâ€™s life. My experience would help me as a software engineer to better understand product requirements, and work in a team. Building an app from scratch is really exciting. Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on front-end projects
